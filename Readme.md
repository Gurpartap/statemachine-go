Implement Finite-State Machines In Go

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/Gurpartap/statemachine-go?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/Gurpartap/statemachine-go)

## Introduction

State machines provide an alternative way of thinking about how your workflows
may be implemented.

Using a state machine for an object, that reacts to events differently based on
its current state, reduces the amount of boilerplate and duct-taping you have
to introduce to your code. 

The `statemachine` package provides a feature complete implementation of
finite-state machines in Go.

#### What Is A Finite-State Machine Even?

> A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural:
> automata), finite automaton, or simply a state machine, is a mathematical
> model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one
> of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one
> state to another in response to some external inputs; the change from one
> state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its
> states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition.

In other words, state machines are utilized for automation of entities that
have a state, an example of which is implemented across [usage](#usage) below.
In the examples, I'm simulating a state machine for an executable [process](https://github.com/Gurpartap/cognizant/blob/master/lib/cognizant/process.rb#L28-L87)
running in an operating system.

State machines are also useful for, although not limited to, long lived
workflows. For example, in a visa application at an embassy, the application
workflow can be implemented with a state machine which may assist with the
automation of state transitions of:

- manual checking (e.g. manually verifying submitted documents)
- user input (e.g. the visa application requiring additional user input)
- time interval (e.g. 24 hours before the application moves into next state)
- notifications (e.g. automated notification of state changes to the applicant)
- and so on.

In some cases, however, even if state machine appears to be a useful approach,
it might actually be completely unnecessary to introduce an external package.
For example, a user sign up flow does not necessarily need to be a state
machine. Perhaps just a sequence of operations like, `validateInput()`,
`migrateFromV1()`, `saveUser()`, and `notifyEmail()`. might be enough. Or even
a quickly tailored switch state based state machine might suffice.

### Goals

Performance is a fairly significant factor when considering the use of
a third party package. However, an API that I can actually code and design in
my mind, ahead of using it, is just as important to me.

`statemachine`'s API design and developer productivity take precedence over
its benchmark numbers (especially when compared to a bare metal switch
statement based state machine implementation, which doesn't take you far).

For this, the package provides DSL-ish API using builder objects. These
builders compute and verify the developer defined specs. They then inject the
result (states, events, transitions, callbacks, etc) into the state machine
object during its initialization. Subsequently, these builders get released
from the memory. The state _machinery_ is not dependent on builders, however.

### Project Status

This readme and the included examples define the specifications and feasible
feature-set of the project. These act as a lookahead reference for the
project's development. Currently, therefore, what you see here is ahead of what
you'll be able to use in code.

## Installation

```bash
$ dep ensure -add https://github.com/Gurpartap/statemachine-go
```

```bash
$ go get -u https://github.com/Gurpartap/statemachine-go
```

## Usage

A state machine definition comprises of the following components:

- [States and Initial State](#states-and-initial-state)
- [Events](#events)
- [Transitions](#transitions)
- [Transition Guards](#transition-guards-conditions)
- [Transition Callbacks](#transition-callbacks)

Each of these components are covered below, along with their example usage
code.

Adding a state machine is as simple as embedding statemachine.Machine in
your struct, defining states and events, along with their transitions.

```go
type Process struct {
	statemachine.Machine
	
	// or
	
	Machine statemachine.Machine
}
```

States, events, and transitions are defined using, what I call "builders",
which including `statemachine.MachineBuilder` and
`statemachine.EventBuilder`. These builders provide a clean DSL for writing
the specification of how the state machine functions.  

The subsequent examples are a close port of
[my experience](https://github.com/Gurpartap/cognizant/blob/master/lib/cognizant/process.rb#L28-L87)
with using the [state_machines](https://github.com/state-machines/state_machines)
Ruby gem.

### States and Initial State

Possible states in the state machine may be manually defined, along with its
initial state. States are, however, also inferred and collected from event
transition definitions.

Initial state is set during the initialization of the state machine, and is
required to be defined in the builder.

```go
process.Machine.Build(func(m statemachine.MachineBuilder) {
	m.States("unmonitored", "running", "stopped")
	m.States("starting", "stopping", "restarting")

	// Initial state must be defined.
	m.InitialState("unmonitored")
})
```

### Events

Events act as a virtual function which when fired, trigger a state transition.

```go
process.Machine.Build(func(m statemachine.MachineBuilder) {
	m.Event("monitor", ... )

	m.Event("start", ... )

	m.Event("stop", ... )

	m.Event("restart", ... )

	m.Event("unmonitor", ... )
	
	m.Event("tick", ... )
})
```

### Transitions

Transitions represent the change in state when an event is fired.

Note that `.From(states ... string)`, `.To(states ...string)`, etc. accept
variadic values.

```go
process.Machine.Build(func(m statemachine.MachineBuilder) {
	m.Event("monitor", func(e statemachine.EventBuilder) {
		e.Transition().From("unmonitored").To("stopped")
	})

	// Note that you can set multiple From states.
	// The same goes for To states.
	m.Event("start", func(e statemachine.EventBuilder) {
		e.Transition().From("unmonitored", "stopped").To("starting")
	})

	m.Event("stop", func(e statemachine.EventBuilder) {
		e.Transition().From("running").To("stopping")
	})

	m.Event("restart", func(e statemachine.EventBuilder) {
		e.Transition().From("running", "stopped").To("restarting")
	})

	m.Event("unmonitor", func(e statemachine.EventBuilder) {
		e.Transition().FromAny().To("unmonitored")
	})
	
	m.Event("tick", func(e statemachine.EventBuilder) {
		// ...
	})
})
```

### Transition Guards (Conditions)

Transition Guards are conditional callbacks which expect a boolean return
value, implying whether or not the transition in context should occur.

Callback function signature:

```go
func(t statemachine.Transition) bool
```

```go
// Assuming process.GetIsProcessRunning() returns a bool.

m.Event("tick", func(e statemachine.EventBuilder) {
	// If guard
	e.Transition().From("starting").To("running").If(process.GetIsProcessRunning)
	
	// Unless guard
	e.Transition().From("starting").To("stopped").Unless(process.GetIsProcessRunning)

	// ...

	e.Transition().From("stopped").To("starting").If(func(t statemachine.Transition) bool {
		return process.ShouldAutoStart && !process.GetIsProcessRunning()
	})

	// ...
})
```

### Transition Callbacks	

Transition Callback methods are called before, around, after, or upon a
transition failure. The following 4 transition callbacks are available:

- [Before Transition](#before-transition)
- [Around Transition](#around-transition)
- [After Transition](#after-transition)
- [After Failure](#after-failure)

#### Before Transition

Before transition callbacks do not act as a conditional, and a bool return
value will not impact the transition. 

Callback function signature:

```go
func(t statemachine.Transition)
```

```go
process.Machine.Build(func(m statemachine.MachineBuilder) {
	// ...
	
	m.BeforeTransition().FromAny().To("stopping").Do(func(t statemachine.Transition) { 
		process.ShouldAutoStart = false
	})
	
	// ...
}
```

#### Around Transition

Around transition's callback provides a method signature as input, which must
be called inside the callback. Missing to call the method will trigger a
runtime failure with an appropriately describing error. 

Callback function signature:

```go
func(t statemachine.Transition, exec func())
```

```go
process.Machine.Build(func(m statemachine.MachineBuilder) {
	// ...

	m.
		AroundTransition().
		From("starting", "restarting").
		To("running").
		Do(func(t statemachine.Transition, exec func()) {
			start := time.Now()

			// It'll trigger a failure if exec func is not called.
			exec()

			end := time.Now()
			elapsed = end.Sub(start)

			log.Printf("It took %s to [re]start the process.\n", elapsed)
		})

	// ...
})
```

#### After Transition

After transition callback is called when the state has successfully
transitioned.

Callback function signature:

```go
func(t statemachine.Transition)
```

```go
process.Machine.Build(func(m statemachine.MachineBuilder) {
	// ...

	// Notify system admin.
	m.AfterTransition().From("running").ToAny().Do(process.DialHome)

	// Log all transitions.
	m.
		AfterTransition().
		FromAny().
		ToAny().
		Do(func(t statemachine.Transition) {
			log.Printf("State changed from '%s' to '%s'.\n", t.GetFrom(), t.GetTo())
		})
	
	// ...
})
```

#### After Failure

After failure callback is called when there's an error while transitioning.

Callback function signature:

```go
func(t statemachine.Transition, err error)
```

```go
process.Machine.Build(func(m statemachine.MachineBuilder) {
	// ...
	
	m.
		AfterFailure().
		FromAny().
		ToAny().
		Do(func(t statemachine.Transition, err error) {
			log.Printf("Error occurred when transitioning from '%s' to '%s':\n", t.GetFrom(), t.GetTo())
			log.Println(err)
		})
	
	// ...
})
```

### Matchers

#### Event Transition Matchers

These may map from one or more `from` states to exactly one `to` state.

```go
.From(...string)
.From(...string).ExceptFrom(...string)
.FromAny()
.FromAnyExcept(...string)

.To(string)
```

##### Examples

```go
e.Transition().From("first_gear").To("second_gear")

e.Transition().From("first_gear", "second_gear", "third_gear").To("stalled")

allGears := vehicle.GetAllGearStates()
e.Transition().From(allGears...).ExceptFrom("neutral_gear").To("stalled")

e.Transition().FromAny().To("stalled")

e.Transition().FromAnyExcept("neutral_gear").To("stalled")
```

#### Transition Callback Matchers

These may map from one or more `from` states to one or more `to` states. 

```go
.From(...string)
.From(...string).ExceptFrom(...string)
.FromAny()
.FromAnyExcept(...string)

.To(...string)
.ToSame()
.ToAny()
.ToAnyExcept(...string)
```

##### Examples

```go
m.BeforeTransition().From("idle").ToAny().Do(someFunc)

m.AroundTransition().From("state_x").ToAnyExcept("state_y").Do(someFunc)

m.AfterTransition().FromAny().ToAny().Do(someFunc)

m.AfterFailure().FromAnyExcept("state_z").ToSame().Do(someFunc)
```

#### Callback Functions

Any callback function's arguments (and return types) are dynamically set based
on what types are defined (dependency injection), and therefore, unnecessary
variables may be skipped. In other words, all input parameters are optional and
return types are optional.

For example, if your BeforeTransition() callback does not need access to the
`statemachine.Transition` variable, you may just define the callback with a
blank function signature: `func() bool`, instead of
`func(t statemachine.Transition) bool`. Similarly, for an AfterFailure()
callback you can use `func(err error)`, or
`func(t statemachine.Transition, err error)`, or even just `func()` .
